# Latex-makro-keypad
A makro keypad for Latex using a Teensy4.0


partslist:
-teensy4.0 + micro usb cable
-20 SMK 2nd gen Switches (can be replaced for any Mechanical switch with MX mount)
-20 Diodes
-4 M3x10 bolts 
-4 rubber feet
-some wire

I used SMK 2nd gen switches with MX mount, so the STL files are cherry mx compatible.
Diodes were used to prevent Ghosting.
The M3 bolts will self-tap into the shell.
